//  but in the services the owner is the owner of the serviceProvider who is the parent of the service)
// 3. approve and reject represents the approval of an (admin  or superAdmin), approve means that it can be used.
// 4. superAdmin, admin, superUser are deferent
// 6.super user can access everything but its written here to illustrate the point
